Hello there! I'm Parham Kazemi, a PhD student at UBC, supervised by Dr. Inanc Birol at BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre. I have a BSc and MSc degree in computer engineering, where I mainly focused on algorithm design, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. I've gone for a PhD in bioinformatics to find ways to extract information from [the language of genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_the_Genes) the same way we grant computers the ability to understand and generate human language.

When I'm not busy doing student-y stuff, I usually [watch movies](https://letterboxd.com/parham_k/), [listen to progressive or indie music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4whxd9bi8cFe0AyEBvmKxy), [laugh to British comedy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb1CG3kQc5PbuHKJtbA6vmBGgvXANeEQk), or [enjoy getting soaked in Vancouver's rainy weather](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pluviophile).

Please feel free to chat, email, or message me where/whenever you want to. My friends keep telling me I'm approachable and easy-going, and I try and hope to really be so!

Oh, and don't worry about pronouncing my name. It's /pær hɑːm/ to be precise, but do go with anything that sounds more natural to you :) If you're curious, [Parham means "an angel of kindness" in Persian](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%BE%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85).
