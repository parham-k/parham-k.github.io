<div class="page-title__text">Parham: yet another human being</div>

**Abstract** To this day, about 7.8 billion people live on planet Earth, each having their own story to tell. Here, we introduce Parham, a random person 

## Introduction



{: style="text-align: justify" }
Hello there! I'm Parham, a PhD student at UBC, supervised by Dr. Inanc Birol at BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
I have a BSc and MSc degree in computer engineering, where I mainly focused on algorithm design, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. I've gone for a PhD in bioinformatics to find ways to extract information from [the language of genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_the_Genes) the same way we train computers to understand and generate human language.

But let's leave the work-related stuff for [my CV](/cv). I have a life outside work anyway! I live in Rain... sorry, Vancouver, but love travelling all around the world.

Please feel free to chat, email, or message me wherever/whenever you want to. My friends keep telling me I'm approachable and easy-going, and I try to really be so!

Oh, and don't worry about pronouncing my name. It's /pær hɑːm/ to be precise (like cat-car), but do go with anything that sounds more natural to you :)
