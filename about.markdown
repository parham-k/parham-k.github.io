Hello there! I'm Parham, a PhD student at UBC, supervised by Dr. Inanc Birol at BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre. I have a BSc and MSc degree in computer engineering, where I mainly focused on algorithm design, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. I've gone for a PhD in bioinformatics to find ways to extract information from [the language of genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_the_Genes) the same way we train computers to understand and generate human language.

Please feel free to chat, email, or message me wherever/whenever you want to. My friends keep telling me I'm approachable and easy-going, and I try to really be so!

Oh, and don't worry about pronouncing my name. It's /pær hɑːm/ to be precise (like cat-car), but do go with anything that sounds more natural to you :)
