### About me

I'm Parham, and I live and study in Vancouver. I enjoy learning new things, [listening to prog rock](https://open.spotify.com/user/31rr2mm2xt3iqu6ynptnmelradwe) (especially Porcupine Tree and Opeth), planespotting, mobile photography, and rainy weather. Watching TV shows and sci-fi/fantasy films is another of my hobbies---I love The Simpsons, Top Gear/The Grand Tour, Star Wars, and The Lord of the Rings. My favorite sport is football/soccer, and I'm a huge Manchester United fan.

### Work and study

I'm a PhD student in the Bioinformatics program at [The University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/), and a member of the [Bioinformatics Technology Lab (BTL)](https://www.birollab.ca/) led by Dr. Inanc Birol at [BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre (BCGSC)](https://www.bcgsc.ca/). My background is in algorithm design, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Currently, I develop fundamental algorithms for sequence analysis and apply machine learning to genome assembly pipelines.
