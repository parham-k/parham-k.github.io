### About me

Hello there! I'm Parham, a guy on a journey of curiosity and exploration. I'm all about learning, [listening to prog rock](https://open.spotify.com/user/31rr2mm2xt3iqu6ynptnmelradwe) (Porcupine Tree and Opeth are my favorites), planespotting, and mobile photography, especially when Vancouver's rain adds that magical touch. I get glued to the TV when my favorite shows or sci-fi/fantasy films (The Simpsons, Top Gear/The Grand Tour, Star Wars, and The Lord of the Rings) are on, or if it's match day for Manchester United.

I always enjoy meeting new people and making friends, so do feel free to reach out for a chat!

### Work and study

I'm a PhD student in the Bioinformatics program at [The University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/), and a member of the [Bioinformatics Technology Lab (BTL)](https://www.birollab.ca/) led by Dr. Inanc Birol at [BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre (BCGSC)](https://www.bcgsc.ca/). My expertise is in algorithm design, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Currently, I develop fundamental algorithms for sequence analysis and apply machine learning to genome assembly pipelines.
