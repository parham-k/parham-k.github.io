Hello there! I’m Parham, a PhD candidate in the [Bioinformatics program at UBC](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/). I conduct my research at the [Birol Lab](https://www.birollab.ca/) in [Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](https://bcgsc.ca/), where I develop software and train deep learning models for genomic sequence analysis and nanopore signal processing. My background also includes work in reinforcement learning and NLP.

I love photography, music, Soulsborne and strategy video games, and all things related to cars. I’m also a huge Manchester United fan. Feel free to connect on any of the social media platforms listed below!
