Hello there! I’m Parham, a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/">Bioinformatics program at UBC, Vancouver</a>. I work at the <a href="https://www.birollab.ca/">Birol Lab</a> at <a href="https://bcgsc.ca/">BC Cancer’s Genome Sciences Centre</a>, where my current research focuses on applying machine learning to genome assembly and methylation analysis, along with deep learning for nanopore signal data. During my master’s, I explored reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

Outside of research, I enjoy photography, listening to music (some of my favorite bands are Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Blur, Soen, Anathema, Antimatter, and Gojira), and anything related to cars. I’m also a huge Manchester United fan.
