I'm Parham, a PhD student in the Bioinformatics program at [The University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/), and a member of the [Bioinformatics Technology Lab (BTL)](https://www.birollab.ca/) led by Dr. Inanc Birol at [BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre (BCGSC)](https://www.bcgsc.ca/).

My background is in algorithm design, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Currently, my work is focused on fundamental algorithms for sequence analysis and machine learning in genome assembly pipelines.

For work-related matters, please email me at "pkazemi[at]bcgsc[dot]ca".
